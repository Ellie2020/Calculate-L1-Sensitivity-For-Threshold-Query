# L1-Sensitivity-For-Threshold-Query
Udacity & Facebook Private AI Challenge Scholarship 

The task is to measure sensitivity when people are removed from a database.
In this repo are reported solutions for this project (Lesson 4-Evaluating Privacy of a Function). 
The database comprises of an input dataset from which all other datasets are originated by removing one sample only (e.g. different sample every time) per dataset.

Sensitivity is calculated for different type of queries (sum, mean and threshold).
